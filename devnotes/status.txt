Project Status
-------------------------------
Started moving into design actualization with CSS. Looks like proportions are way off in the illustrator predraft, may have to scrap design with maingraphic or extend maingraphic to go for a wider dimension.

Will have to consider mobile layout. I'm not good with these design tasks.


Agenda
-------------------------------
Realize mockup of index.html, using dummy stubs for links
Create other pages and replace dummy stubs, test links
